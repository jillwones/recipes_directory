## Task

1. Design and create the table for the following user stories.  

    ```
    As a food lover,
    So I can stay organised and decide what to cook,
    I'd like to keep a list of all my recipes with their names.

    As a food lover,
    So I can stay organised and decide what to cook,
    I'd like to keep the average cooking time (in minutes) for each recipe.

    As a food lover,
    So I can stay organised and decide what to cook,
    I'd like to give a rating to each of the recipes (from 1 to 5).
    ```
2. Test-drive the Repository class for this new table. You should design,
   test-drive and implement two methods `all` and `find`.
3. Write code in the main file `app.rb` so it prints out the list of recipes.
